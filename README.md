# Religiosity_Proportion

This personal project utilized a dataset acquired from Kaggle. The dataset consists of survey responses from a random sample of users collected through SurveyMonkey.

The goal of the analysis was to determine whether the sample suggests that a majority of individuals are religious or spiritual.

The null hypothesis (H0) states that the proportion of individuals who are religious or spiritual is equal to 50%. The alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ) states that the proportion of individuals who are religious or spiritual is greater than 50%.

After checking the assumptions for a hypothesis test for a proportion and completing a binomial test, the p-value suggests that the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The data suggests that the proportion of individuals who are religious or spiritual is greater than 50%.
